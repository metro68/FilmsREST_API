# FilmsREST_API
A REST-ful-ish API for films loaded into a database from a CSV file 

This project loads a csv file of film records containing fields such as the actors, actresses, directors, year produced into a database and provides methods for accessing various attributes of the file.

These include being able to fetch films by date released or by actors in them.
